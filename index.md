## About Me

Hi, Thanks for visiting my webpage.

I am a PhD student in Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. By profession, I am a Mechanical engineer but my main interest is in the mathematical approaches to understand the phys4ical phenomenons. Currently, I am interested in the study of Wormhole formation in porous rocks due to reactive flow. I love to do things related to thinking. I love to read literatures of history, evolution of society and languages. I can play an Indian classical music instrument, Bamboo Flute. Now a days, I realised that to jot down something conclusive from my thorough thinking process, I should start writing the blogs. So I am writing my first blog and will update here soon.

I look forward to see you again, perhaps for my blog.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
